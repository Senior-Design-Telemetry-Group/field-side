# Field-Side realtime monitoring tool
This is a python program intended to connect to our car-side system to provide real time telemetry information

## Setup
1) Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside this directory. (Might be `pip3` instead on some systems!)
3) Run `main.py` with python, on some environments this can be done with a double click. Otherwise open a terminal and run `python main.py`. (Might be `python3` on some systems!)
